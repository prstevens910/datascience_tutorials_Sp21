Why version control?\n","\n","Keeping with the \"Document everything you do\" mentality, it's useful to have a plan for managing changes to your analysis and modelling projects early on. Imagine the following common situation. You have a working analysis script, but you decide to do additional analyses requested by your colleague (or advisor, or reviewer). You make the required changes, and while your new analysis works fine, suddenly you find that you can't replicate your previous results - they give you an error, or your results look different than before.\n","\n","This type of thing happens surprisingly often. One way to deal with that is to always backup and then copy your script, and make changes to the copy. While this may work for simple cases, it becomes unwieldy quickly and you can end up with 10 versions of your analyses. At this point you are in a similarly confusing situation, because you have to figure out which file is the right one. If you work with other people on the same analyses, this becomes even more problematic."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YYGTRCOf7kPF"},"source":["## 2. What are git and GitHub?\n","\n","This is where version control with [git](https://git-scm.com/) comes in handy! Git is a system that allows you to track the changes you or others make to your files, log the purpose of those changes, and go back and forth between different versions. \n","\n","The basic idea is that for each project that you manage, you establish what is called a *repository* for that project with git. That repository contains the files for your project, and using various commands you can instruct it what to do when you make changes to your files. \n","\n","Git is a command-line tool, which you control by typing commands in a console/terminal. If you are not comfortable doing that, you can use a GUI (graphical user interface) application. One is provided when you install git, but a much better one comes with GitHub (see next paragraph), which has a familiar user-interface that allows you to just point-and-click to the most common options. There is also [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) which is independent of GitHub but a more comprehensive GUI. The command-line tool is more versatile, but if you prefer to use the app that is a-okay.\n","\n","Now that we know what git is, what is GitHub? Well, git allows you to create repositories on your own computer. GitHub is a complementary service that allows you to host your repositories online via the [github.com](https://github.com) platform. That way you can share your work with collaborators, access it on different computers, and the changes you make are all synced to this central server.\n","\n","For this tutorial, you will need to:\n","\n","1. Type ```git --version``` into your terminal to check whether you already have git installed. If not, install git.\n","\n","2. Go to https://git-scm.com/ and download the appropriate git version for your system\n","\n","3. Run the file and follow the steps to install. \n","\n","4. Sign up for a GitHub account (use your academic .edu address - that will allow you to create private repositories) \n","\n","5.

You need to explicitly tell git which files in the folder need to be tracked. This allows you to store in the same folder both files that you need to keep a version control on, such as scripts and drafts, but also other files that you do not want to track, such as experimental stimuli, etc. You can add specific files with the following command:\n","\n","```bash\n","git add script1.R script2.R\n","```\n","\n","Or you can also add all files in your folder by using an `*` rather than a specific filename:\n","```bash\n","git add *\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DbXLKOKi7kPI"},"source":["#### 3.7 Commiting changes\n","\n","Adding files means telling git that it should track changes in those files. However, in contrast to the \"Track changes\" options in Word, it does not do it continuously and automatically - you have to tell git when you want the changes you've made to be recorded! Git calls this \"commiting\". There is a good reason for this - you want to record changes at specific identifiable moments which can allow you to go back to a specific version you need. Let's say that you have just spent some time revising your analysis script by changing the regression model you are using. You can commit your new changes with the commit command. You also want to describe briefly the changes you've made so that you can identify the version later. You do this by adding -m \"My description\" to the commit command:\n","\n","```bash\n","git commit -m \"Change regression model to logistic\"\n","```\n","\n","At this point, all of your changes are recorded in a single commit session.

You have made changes and saved them, but this hasn't really affected any part of your workflow. Let's talk about branches.\n","\n","If you imagine your project as a tree, you can think of each branch of a tree as an alternative version of your project. You can work on multiple versions/branches of your project at the same time. Your main branch is called **master**. It is automatically created when you initialize a repository and unless you create other branches, it will be the only one. At any point in time, you will always be in a certain branch, and any changes you make to your files at that time will only be made to files in that branch. When you create a new branch, you make a copy of the branch from which you created it. Importantly, this does not actually copy your files, and if you go into your project folder you will not see anything different at that point. Once you've made and commit any changes, you can switch between branches. Any time you switch to a branch, the files in your folder will be replaced with the files corresponding to the last changes in the branch. You can also merge branches together, implementing changes from one branch into another.\n","\n","![picture](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12FwkUrkU3RMa7ed_tA9D-KZLwbZsJhsy)\n","\n","[*image source*](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)\n","\n","How is this useful? A very common workflow that protects your files is one in which you have two branches, a **master** branch, and a **development** branch. In this setup, you never work in your master branch - you always make changes in the development branch and once you are satisfied with those changes, you merge them into your master branch. That allows you to easily switch between your current in-progress changes and your last working version of your script in your master branch.\n","\n","To create a new branch and switch to it you can use the following command:\n","\n","```bash\n","git checkout -b nameofnewbranch\n","```\n","\n","At this point you can make any changes to your project that you like, and use the commands discussed before to add the files and commit your changes. When you do this, your new branch will contain your changes, but your **master** branch will contain a version of the repository prior to the creation of the new branch. \n","\n","The **`checkout`** command allows you not only to create new branches, when putting the **`-b branchname`** operator, but also to switch from one branch to another existing one. To do that, type the command without the **-b** operator, with the name of the branch you want to switch into. If you want to go back to your master branch:\n","\n","```bash\n","git checkout master\n","```\n","\n","If you now check your files, they should not contain the changes you made. You can easily go back to that branch with:\n","\n","```bash\n","git checkout nameofnewbranch\n","```\n","\n","There are many different ways to use branches. If you are simultaneously testing several different versions of your analyses, you can create one branch for each, and easily switch back and forth between them, until you decide which version you want to keep.

You need to merge your *dev* branch with your *master*. Any time you merge two branches together, git compares their contents, checks for conflicts and combines any changes made in the different branches. In the simplest case, where you've only made changes to one of the branches, it will just replace the files in the other with the newer version. If, you've made changes to the same file under different branches, it will try to merge them. If the changes are about different parts of the file, it will combine them with no problem most of the time. If the changes are to the same lines in a file, it will create a conflict error that you will have to resolve manually. For now, just avoid doing that, and let's assume you've made changes only to one branch. When you merge branches, you implement the changes in whatever branch you are currently in. So, to update our master branch with the contents of **dev**, we first switch to **master**, and then invoke the merge command like this:\n","\n","```bash\n","git checkout master\n","git merge dev\n","```\n","\n","At this point, if you want to continue working on dev, you should switch back to it first. If you were working on a branch devoted to a specific version, let's say called **weirdtestbranch**, that you no longer need because you have merged it, you can delete the experimental branch with the following command:\n","\n","```bash\n","git branch -d weirdtestbranch\n","```\n","\n","This command will not let you delete a branch that has not been merged yet.
