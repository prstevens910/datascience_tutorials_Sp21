# datascience_tutorials_Sp21
Python notebook tutorials, either authored or revised by Patience Stevens, for Data Science for Psychology &amp; Neuroscience (TA in Spring 2021)

******************

This is a repository of the Google Colab tutorials on using R for scientific computation, and on implementing data science techniques, for CMU class Data Science for Psychology and Neuroscience.

As Teaching Assistant for this class in Spring 2021, I (Patience Stevens) made significant edits to all tutorials, added new material to certain tutorials (9 - Linear models) and created four entirely new tutorials (10 - Least Squares, 14 - kNN, 18 - Mediation, 21 - Principal Component Methods). 

In addition to editing / creating these tutorials and adapting them from Jupyter Notebooks to Google Colab, I created homeworks, graded homeworks, and led class discussions of data science concepts.
